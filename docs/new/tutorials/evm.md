In this guide, you'll learn how to initialize an EVM-based Substreams project within the Dev Container.

## Step 1: Initialize Your EVM Substreams Project

1. Open the [Dev Container](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-starter) and follow the on-screen steps to initialize your project.
    
2. Running `substreams init` will give you the option to choose between two EVM project options. Select the one that best fits your requirements:
    - **evm-minimal**: Creates a simple Substreams that extracts raw EVM block data and generates corresponding Rust code. This path will start you with the full raw block, you can navigate to the `substreams.yaml` (the manifest) to modify the input.
    - **evm-events-calls**: Creates a Substreams that extracts and decodes EVM events and calls using the cached [EVM Foundational Module](https://substreams.dev/streamingfast/ethereum-common/v0.3.0), filtered by one or more smart contract addresses. Contract ABIs are retrieved from Etherscan. If an ABI isn’t available, you’ll need to provide it yourself.

## Step 2: Visualize the Data

1. Run `substreams auth` to create your [account](https://thegraph.market/) and generate an authentification token (JWT), then pass this token back as input.

2. Now you can freely use the `substreams gui` to visualize and itterate on your extracted data.

## Step 2.5: (Optionally) Transform the Data 

Within the generated directories, modify your Substreams modules to include additional filters, aggregations, and transformations, then update the manifest accordingly. To learn more about this, visit the [How-to-Guides](../how-to-guides/develop-your-own-substreams/evm/exploring-ethereum/exploring-ethereum.md)

## Step 3: Load the Data

To make your Substreams queriable (as opposed to [direct streaming](../how-to-guides/sinks/stream/stream.md)), you can automatically generate a Subgraph (known as a [Substreams-powered subgraph](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/sps/introduction/)) or SQL-DB sink.

### Subgraph

1. Run `substreams codegen subgraph` to intialize the sink, producing the neccessary files and function definitions. 
2. Create your [subgraph mappings](../how-to-guides/sinks/subgraph/triggers.md) within the `mappings.ts` and associated entities within the `schema.graphql`.
3.  Deploy

### SQL

1. Run `substreams codegen sql` and choose from either ClickHouse or Postgres to intialize the sink, producing the neccessary files. 
2. Run `substreams build` build the [Substreams:SQL](../how-to-guides/sinks/sql/sql-sink.md) sink. 
3. Run `substreams-sink-sql` to sink the data into your selected SQL DB.
